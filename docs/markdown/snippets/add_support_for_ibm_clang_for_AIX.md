## Support for OpenXL compiler in AIX.

The OpenXL compiler is now supported from Meson 1.6.0 onwards.
So currently, in AIX Operating system we support GCC and openXL compilers for Meson build system.

Both the compilers will archive shared libraries and generate a shared object
for a shared module while using Meson in AIX.
