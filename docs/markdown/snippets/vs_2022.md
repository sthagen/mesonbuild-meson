## Visual Studio 2022 backend

As Visual Studio 2022 is released recently, it's time to support the
new version in Meson. This mainly includes the new "v143" platform tools.

The usage is similar to other backends. For example
```meson
meson setup builddir --backend=vs2022
```
will configure "builddir" for projects compatible with Visual Studio 2022.
